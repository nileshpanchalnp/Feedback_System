# Event Feedback System

# Project Overview
The Event Feedback System is a full-stack **web application built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Express.js for the backend**. **It allows users to create events, submit feedback, and manage their feedback history efficiently**. All data is securely stored and managed in the cloud using **MongoDB Atlas**.

# 🔑 Key Features
**✅ Event Creation**
Users can create new events by providing details like event name, date, and description.

**📝 Submit Feedback**
Users can give feedback on events, including comments and ratings.

**📋 Feedback History**
Logged-in users can view a personal history of all feedback they have submitted.

**✏️ Edit/Delete Feedback**
Users can update or delete their own feedback anytime.

**🔐 User Authentication**
Secure login and sign-up system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to protect user data.

**🔍 Event Category Search Feature**
💻 How It Works (User Flow):
The user sees a search bar labeled "Search by Category".

They type in a category name or keyword.

**On clicking the Search button:**

The app filters the events based on the input.

The filtered events are shown immediately below.

If no matches are found, the app notifies the user accordingly.

**🔒 Protected Routes**
Only authenticated users can access feedback functionalities and personal history.

**🌐 Cloud Database**
All event and feedback data is stored in MongoDB Atlas, ensuring scalability, reliability, and security.

**📱 Responsive Design**
The app is mobile-friendly and works smoothly on all screen sizes.
