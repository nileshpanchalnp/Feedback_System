# Event Feedback System

# Project Overview
The Event Feedback System is a full-stack **web application built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Express.js for the backend**. **It allows users to create events, submit feedback, and manage their feedback history efficiently**. All data is securely stored and managed in the cloud using **MongoDB Atlas**.

# üîë Key Features
**‚úÖ Event Creation**
Users can create new events by providing details like event name, date, and description.

**üìù Submit Feedback**
Users can give feedback on events, including comments and ratings.

**üìã Feedback History**
Logged-in users can view a personal history of all feedback they have submitted.

**‚úèÔ∏è Edit/Delete Feedback**
Users can update or delete their own feedback anytime.

**üîê User Authentication**
Secure login and sign-up system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to protect user data.

**üîí Protected Routes**
Only authenticated users can access feedback functionalities and personal history.

**üåê Cloud Database**
All event and feedback data is stored in MongoDB Atlas, ensuring scalability, reliability, and security.

**üì± Responsive Design**
The app is mobile-friendly and works smoothly on all screen sizes.

# Technical Specifications:
  **Frontend**: React.js (React Router, Hooks, Tailwind CSS)
  
  **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, JWT (for authentication), Mongoose (for interacting with MongoDB Atlas)
  
  **Data Storage**: MongoDB Atlas
  
  **State Management**: React Hooks
  
  **Deployment**: Hosted on Vercel

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
